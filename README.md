### TeamSnap API Exploration

This app is created to explore the TeamSnap API. The TeamSnap API is a Collection+JSON type API. 

This app will use OAuth2 to authenticate that the user has access to their information via the TeamSnap API. Once authenticated it will show team info, member info, and other stats related to the user/team. 

The purpose of this app is to learn the TeamSnap API, and to learn how to navigate a Collection+JSON API. The functionality of the app is much more well suited for a Single Page app and a front-end framework such as Ember or Angular would be a better choice to carry this type of app forward. It is built in Rails to see what connecting to the TeamSnap API through Rails could look like.
